## Reflection
- [ ] This project is completed and coded along upon the course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/building-real-time-rest-apis-with-spring-boot/learn/lecture/28676628#content
- [ ] By taking this course, I have exposed myself to Java backend development. The coding concepts of Rest API development and deployment are straightforward to me. Securing APIs with Spring security and JWT is quite complex so I would need to practice more on that aspect.
